Your goal is clear and you explain why OS detection matters without overdoing it. In the final deliverables: One small thing you might want to tighten up is the section on models. Right now it reads like you are not sure where to start, which is totally fine for a proposal, but you could at least name a couple realistic candidates you are curious about trying, maybe a simple linear model, a tree based model, and a NN based model? (You don't have to stick with these but levels of increasing complexity might yield interesting results). Also, it might help to say a bit about how you will handle the feature extraction step since nPrint offers different knobs there and that will probably matter for your results. Everything else looks well structured and the plan is very doable.
