Download pretrained models from the [Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vXRKuW0KuB50WY1vgi5GFwIn-coFk_25?usp=sharing). 

Extract the model directories here. You should have folders like:
- ag-20251121_041416
- ag-20251121_042419
- ag-20251121_045052
- ag-20251121_062856
- ag-20251121_064045
- ag-20251121_065222

Alternatively, uncomment the training code in the notebook to train models which will take a decent amount of time
